This folder contains R source code to produce the simulation study based on the Bottomly et al. (2011) dataset.

The files should be run in the following order:

"NB_disp_estimates.R"
"Simulation_output.R"
 - once with k.ind (simulation sample size) set to 3
"benchmarks.R"
 - once with k.ind (simulation sample size) set to 3
"FDR_Plots.R"

The file "simulation_output.R" will take a while to run due to the long computational time needed for each statistical analysis method.
